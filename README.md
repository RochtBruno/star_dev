# star_dev
- This is a front end project that uses two differents APIs.
- The APIs used were swapi and apiquotes
- Swapi was used to get data to show the number of planets, starships and characters in the star wars movie
- Apiquotes was used to generate the ramdom quotes that appears when you click on the button
- The project is based on html,css and javascript only
- Pretty simple,clean and intuitive project, but if you had any doubt about anything don't hesitate to contact me!
- See ya!:)
